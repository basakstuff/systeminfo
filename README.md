In this assignment, it will apply a system call to the linux kernel and then create that kernel. After creating it, the system call in the code was searched and run into the user area. </br>
</br>
The code that enters the user area executes the system call called "systeminfo". The code takes two parameters, -p and -all. First of all, it prints information about the CPU such as processor, vendor ID, CPU family, model name, CPU MHz.
</br>

●“-p processID”, it prints some details about the given process ID such as user, pid,
start_time, command.</br>
</br>
● “-all”, it prints the length of time since the system was booted, as well as the amount of
time since then that the system has been idle, the number of active tasks on the system and
and the total number of processes on the system.
